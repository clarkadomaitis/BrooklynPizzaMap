        The first pizzeria in the United States of America was opened in 1905 by Gennaro Lombardi, an Italian immigrant who used <a href="https://www.firstpizza.com">“his bakers’ trade he learned from Naples.”</a>

      </p>
      <p>

        While the first pizza in New York was introduced by Italians, today, the amount of Italians immigrants an area has does not directly correlate to the amount of pizza places it has, according to the data on foreign-born immigrant population in the 2018 American Community Survey and pizza place data from Reference USA.
      </p>
      <p>

        In the instance of Greenpoint/Williamsburg, their neighborhood has the most pizza places, 60, out of any Brooklyn neighborhood, but an average amount of foreign-born Italian immigrants living there, 588.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bensonhurst/Bath Beach has the most Italian immigrants by a wide margin at 5,321, and 48 pizza places, which is the second highest amount of pizza places per neighborhood in Brooklyn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Brownville/Ocean Hill has zero foreign-born Italians living there - but they still have 14 pizza places.

        Matthew K. Gold, Associate Professor of English at the CUNY Graduate Center and Administrator of CUNYPie, a <a href="https://in.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2020/01/31/10-years-of-the-commons-cuny-pie/">"crack team of pizza-loving academics,”</a>
        emphasizes that pizza is now entwined into NYC Culture, and that the amount of foreign-born Italian immigrants in the city would not correlate to how many pizza places the area has.
      </p>
      <p>
        “While restaurants do often serve particular ethnic communities, and thus to be located in neighborhoods with high concentrations of those enthic communities, pizza has become such a ubiquitous form of NYC food that it has in some ways been
        divorced from its particular ethnic history -- in the sense that all New Yorkers now consider pizza to be part of their cultural and geographical culinary inheritance.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I analyzed population data from the 2018 American Community Survey to find the population of foreign-born Italian Immigrants out of the entire population of every Brooklyn community district. The American Community Survey is a <a
          href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs">“demographics survey program conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.”</a> It helps community leaders understand demographic changes taking place in their communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I put this population information on a chart with the amount of pizza places each Brooklyn community district has, using data from <a href="https://www.data-axle.com/what-we-do/reference-solutions/"> Reference USA</a>.
